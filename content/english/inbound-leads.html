                <h2>Getting to cloud native</h2>
                <p>A cloud native application is built to live in the cloud. It auto-provisions, auto-scales, and is auto-resilient, delivering maximum value to a business and its end users. The more successfully an application lives in the cloud without causing lock-in to one provider, the more cloud native it is.</p>
                <p>Most cloud projects won’t meet these standards on the first pass. At the extreme, a lift and shift cloud migration can lead to a business failure due to runaway costs and stability issues. In most cases, projects need to be re-thought, re-tooled, and re-platformed over time to evolve with new technologies. The cloud moves fast.</p>

                <h2>Being cloud native takes expertise that’s hard to come by</h2>
                <p>Most companies are not current on the latest cloud technologies, methods, and practices. Things are always changing and there’s a growing ecosystem of tools and projects to be aware of. No one person can know everything there is to know and most problems don’t have cookie cutter solutions.</p>
                <p>That’s why companies who are serious about succeeding with cloud native projects will pick a partner with the experience and know-how to find unique solutions that match their business, cultural, and technical requirements. They realize their challenges need the perspective of multiple experts to solve and some may have never come up before.</p>
                <p>Even once they’ve received a solution, many won’t have the skills or hands-on experience to operationalize it. Forward-thinking organizations look for certified experts to train and upskill staff members when bringing cloud native solutions in-house. They seek out workshops that get their teams to speed on cloud native technologies, DevOps practices, and infrastructure tooling—while also helping to shift organizational culture and practices to a new way of working.</p>
