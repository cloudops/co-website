                <p>CloudOps supports you in a number of transformations: DevOps transformations to innovate at a faster
                    pace, CloudOps transformations to unlock a cloud service provider business model, and DevNetOps
                    transformations to leverage network-as-code.</p>
                <p>The mounting pressure to deliver on these new ways of working is joined with some very real costs of

                <h2>DevOps Transformation</h2>
                <p>As organizations struggle to overcome legacy drag from aging infrastructures, DevOps philosophies,
                    practices, and tools can align culture and decision-making processes with a new, faster pace of
                    innovation.</p>
                <p>To get there, you will have to navigate a complex DevOps ecosystem, instill the proper culture and
                    skill base in your employees, choose the right tooling and practices, and set up your value stream
                    to evolve over time.</p>
                <p>Our DevOps transformation is built to help you along this process. It begins with an assessment of
                    your organization’s culture and practices. We then provide a blueprint for change, with expert
                    advisors to build your CI/CD pipelines, operators to manage your cloud native application platform,
                    and a variety of workshops to upskill employees. All of this is done while addressing your security
                    and governance needs.</p>
                <p>We jump-start the process of transforming your team into agile DevOps practitioners who collaborate
                    to deliver applications and services at high velocity.</p>
                <p>This will help you better meet customer needs and gain position as a leader and innovator—ultimately
                    helping you hit your business goals faster.</p>

                <p>You aspire to be a software-defined infrastructure provider to your users, enabling new cloud and
                    network offerings that include: edge computing, cloud native technologies, hybrid multi-cloud
                    infrastructures, data sovereign storage solutions, SD-WAN, and more.</p>
                <p>Your team is not yet ready to support this new operational model. You have questions about market
                    demand, costs, and timelines involved. You are also looking for the best strategy—one allows you
                    fast time-to-value while structuring your organization for long-term success.</p>
                <p>You may have been presented with a vision of success by enterprise IT software and hardware vendors,
                    but you know you need a practical and proven approach to bring these new offerings to your users.
                </p>
                <p>CloudOps has the necessary experience in building regional, private, and edge clouds to help you get
                    there faster.</p>
                <p>We will help you clarify your value proposition; document requirements for a minimum viable product
                    (MVP); architect, design, and launch your new service; and teach you to sustain it with cloud
                    product management best practices.</p>
                <p>Launching such a big undertaking requires the buy-in and support of the many business units involved.
                    Our workshops will help you create alignment between your organization’s teams as you define goals,
                    costs, and requirements.</p>
                <p>Your business, technology, and operations teams will be pulling as one in support of your MVP.
                    Consider our CloudOps transformation the smoothest possible on-ramp to the journey of being an IT

                <p>Network Operators (NetOps) rely on vendors for software updates, patches, and other architectural
                    changes. Once received, they often spend weeks troubleshooting and re-architecting changes to
                    maintain network availability.</p>
                <p>The solution? Apply DevOps’ proven philosophies, principles, and practices to network operations with
                    DevNetOps and leverage network-as-code.</p>
                <p>CloudOps assists with DevNetOps transformations, instilling the automations and practices that allow
                    for faster feature releases and fixes, increase network availability, and happier (less stressed)
