<p dir="ltr">CloudOps ranks No. 19 on the <a href="https://www.canadianbusiness.com/growth-list-canadas-fastest-growing-companies/?">2020 Growth List</a> – Canadian Business unveils annual list of Canada’s Fastest-Growing Companies – Montreal, Canada. (October 15, 2020) </p>

<p dir="ltr">Canadian Business today ranked CloudOps No. 19 on the 32nd annual Growth List, the definitive ranking of Canada’s Fastest-Growing Companies. <a href="https://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/meet-canadas-fastest-growing-information-technology-companies-2020-growth-list/">CloudOps ranked No. 2 in the Information Technology category of the list</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">CloudOps made the 2020 Growth List with five-year revenue growth of 11,319%. “The companies on the 2020 Growth List are really exceptional. Their stories are a masterclass in how to survive when the economy throws a curveball. Despite turbulence, the 2020 Growth List companies showed resilience, spirit and, most importantly, empathy and strong leadership,” says Susan Grimbly, Growth List Editor. “As we celebrate over 30 years of the Canada’s Fastest-Growing Companies program, it’s encouraging to see that the heart of Canada’s entrepreneurial community beats strong, even in tough times.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">"CloudOps is honoured to be on the Growth List ranking. The achievement reflects the steady and organic growth we have seen over time, our expertise in both open source and proprietary solutions, and dedication of our team of teams helping customers adopt DevOps and Cloud Native." - Marc Paré, Chief Commercial Officer at CloudOps</p>

<p dir="ltr">Until recently, the challenges of getting an end-user computing strategy based on these kind of virtual workspaces have mainly centered around budget, since up-front investment can be substantial and skill, since knowing how to deploy, manage, and troubleshoot these systems requires deep knowledge of the entire networking and application stack.</p>

Our mission is to ensure our customers own their destiny in the cloud.
