<p>CloudOps will partner with <a href="https://www.telesat.com/">Telesat</a> to build a production hybrid cloud platform as well as enterprise and operational data platforms for real-time and historical satellite data analysis and processing. CloudOps will conduct a discovery of the project before building a pilot to be brought to production.</p>

<p><b>Montreal, Canada, March 26, 2021 - </b>CloudOps is pleased to provide Telesat with cloud consulting and professional services to support the development of its Telesat Lightspeed Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network. With over fifteen years of experience in cloud computing, networking, and DevOps solutions, CloudOps is in a unique position to help Telesat embrace cloud native approaches and hybrid cloud platforms that enable the future of communications.</p>

<p>Telesat, a leading Canadian satellite communications company, has developed a highly innovative global network of 298 LEO satellites that are seamlessly integrated with on-ground data networks. The LEO network will provide underserved, rural areas with affordable, high-speed internet connectivity.  Last month, the Government of Québec announced an investment in Telesat Lightspeed, and recently the Government of Canada concluded a 10-year agreement with Telesat to affordably bridge Canada’s digital divide.</p>

<p>CloudOps has been a partner of Telesat for almost two years in preparation for this project. Recognizing the need to move to cloud native technologies, Telesat leveraged CloudOps’ consulting and professional services to build its first hybrid cloud platform. CloudOps has brought to the project in-depth expertise in a variety of Cloud and DevOps tools, including hyperscale platforms, Kubernetes, Rancher, HashiCorp Vault, Aqua Security, and Snowflake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Modern applications require networks, cloud, and edge computing to work in concert to support rich experiences for customers. This important work will support bringing these applications and experiences to a much broader audience, allowing Canadians and global industries to access more affordable and higher-performance internet experiences. CloudOps is proud to offer its 15 years of experience in multi-cloud and edge computing solutions to support the success of the Telesat Lightspeed service introduction.”

- -Ian Rae, CEO and Founder of CloudOps</p>

<p>Looking forward, CloudOps is pleased to support Telesat's mission to deliver space-based connectivity for its enterprise customers, and transformTelesat into a cloud native-first organization to prepare for the future of 5G, IoT, edge, and AI technologies.</p>
