<p>CloudOps is pleased to announce that we are now a Kubernetes Certified Service Provider (KCSP). Run by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in collaboration with the Linux Foundation, the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/partners/" target="_blank">KCSP</a> program is comprised of 28 vetted service providers with substantial experience helping enterprises adopt Kubernetes successfully. KCSP partners provide support, consulting, and professional services and training for organizations seeking to embrace container solutions. As the only partner in Canada, CloudOps works with partners internationally, and with the CNCF to create a strong and vibrant Kubernetes culture that supports an array of complementary platforms, and fosters the community built around it. As Maximilian Morgan, our VP of Professional Services, said:</p>

<p><em>“We are very excited to be counted among the partners within the Kubernetes ecosystem. CloudOps has been contributing to the Kubernetes community and proliferation in a big way, and will continue to help organizations own their cloud destiny.”</em></p>

<p>Being KCSP demonstrates CloudOps’ advanced expertise in helping enterprises move to a cloud native platform. Acquiring the certification requires three or more internal engineers passing the scrupulous Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam in addition to actively contributing to the Kubernetes community and running a business model that supports enterprise end users. CloudOps’ expertise in Kubernetes is evident in both our <a href="https://hubs.ly/H09H5yn0" target="_blank">Managed Application Platform</a>, and in the <a href="https://hubs.ly/H09H70v0" target="_blank">professional services</a> we provide for cloud building, architecture, migration, and performance. Importantly, we strive to expand the ecosystem by leading two-day <a href="https://hubs.ly/H09vGfD0" target="_blank">workshops</a> on leveraging Docker and Kubernetes to enhance a DevOps workflow.</p>

<p>For a variety of reasons, containers have taken the world by storm and Kubernetes has become the de facto system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. As the fourth highest velocity open source project, the use of Kubernetes is exploding and creating a high demand for specialists that can provide expert migration support and cluster operations services. KCSP is an attestation of CloudOps’ commitment to contribute to the success of Kubernetes as an open-source technology, as well as support its continuously growing community.</p>
