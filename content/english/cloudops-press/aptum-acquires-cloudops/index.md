- *Acquisition will accelerate Aptum’s Digital Customer Experience through CloudOps’ software business*
- *Aptum is in a strong position to become the MSP of MSPs by accelerating their multi-cloud managed services business*

**TORONTO, ON (January 12, 2023):** <a href="https://aptum.com/" target="_blank">Aptum</a>, a hybrid multi-cloud managed service
provider, today announced its acquisition of CloudOps, a Montreal, Canada-based
cloud consulting, managed services and software company focused on open source,
cloud native platforms, networking and DevOps. This strategic acquisition will further
enable Aptum to deliver comprehensive hybrid multi-cloud solutions and services,
which include advanced cloud migration services and DevOps, to its customers in 43
countries.

CloudOps has grown from an operations managed services shop since 2005 to a
leader in cloud computing, cloud networking, and DevOps solutions. Aptum intends
to retain a separate CloudOps unit within its business, and to combine select teams
— including the Advisory and Consulting Services, Support Services and DevOps —
to provide strengthened, streamlined solutions and services to customers.

<blockquote><p>“Aptum has been on a transformational journey over the last three years; we have
not missed a beat on our focus to bring new products and service delivery models to
enable the best hybrid multi-cloud solutions to market,” said Susan Bowen, CEO and
President of Aptum Group. “We’re excited to add CloudOps’ talented team and its
services portfolio to the Aptum family. This strategic move will extend our ability to
serve our customers with solutions such as DevOps and Advanced Cloud Migration
Services, offering true Hybrid Multi-Cloud solutions and services at different stages
of their digital transformation.”</p></blockquote>

CloudOps’ leadership teams and employees will join with Aptum; its headquarters
will remain in Montreal.

<blockquote><p>“Over the last two years of collaborating with Aptum to offer Managed DevOps
services, we have successfully joined forces to help customers accelerate their
application platform engineering and operational excellence in the cloud,” said Ian
Rae, Founder and CEO of CloudOps, who will join Aptum’s Executive Leadership
Team as President and CEO, CloudOps &amp; CloudMC. “Aptum has invested heavily in
its business assurance and Cloud Advisory and Consulting practice, and we are
thrilled to be a part of the organization and to benefit from its global sales, marketing,
and support services. We look forward to helping more customers across a wide
range of industries to own their own destinies in the clouds™ unlocking the true
value of cloud solutions for their businesses.”</p></blockquote>

Aptum will enhance its Hybrid Cloud Management Portal by leveraging CloudMC’s
API-driven, modular and extensible, edge orchestration platform. It will accelerate
the existing development of a single pane of glass for hybrid multi-cloud workload
management.

Additionally, the amalgamation of resources from both companies will extend product
opportunities across multiple sectors beyond telecommunications to include
technology and business services, media and communications, retail, financial
services, manufacturing, energy and utilities, hospitality, education, transportation,
among others. This acquisition will fortify Aptum’s vendor-agnostic approach,
solutions, and services in Canada, U.S. and the U.K across multiple clouds including
Azure (<a href="https://aptum.com/services/cloud/managed-azure/" target="_blank">Aptum recently earned the Microsoft Azure Expert MSP Certification</a>), AWS,
Google, Hypertec Cloud and Cox Edge.

The transaction was completed on January 5, 2023. Terms of the deal will not be
disclosed.
