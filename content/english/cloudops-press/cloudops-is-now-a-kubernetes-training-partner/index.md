<p>CloudOps is happy to announce membership of the newly-founded Kubernetes Training Partner (<a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2018/05/02/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-new-partner-program-for-kubernetes-training-partners-ktp/" target="_blank">KTP</a>) program. Run by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the KTP program focuses on furthering the educational efforts of Kubernetes Certified Service Providers (<a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/kcsp/" target="_blank">KCSP</a>). CloudOps provides support, consulting, professional services, as well as training for organizations seeking to embrace cloud native solutions. As Dan Kohn, Executive Director of CNCF said:</p>

<blockquote><p>“CloudOps has demonstrated a deep knowledge of Kubernetes, as well as noteworthy community initiative around cloud native technologies. We are excited to have the team join this specialized group of training partners.”</p></blockquote>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.cloudops.com/2018/03/cloudops-is-a-member-of-the-linux-foundation-the-lfn-and-the-cncf/" target="_blank">member</a> of the CNCF and the LF Networking Fund (LFN), CloudOps is committed to expanding the Kubernetes ecosystem and bridging the gap between open source networking and cloud native tooling. We also collaborate with both the Centre of Excellence for Next Generation Networks (<a href="https://www.cengn.ca/" target="_blank">CENGN</a>) and <a href="http://www.sdnessentials.com/" target="_blank">SDN Essentials</a>.</p>

<p>We hold regular meetups and workshops throughout Canada and the United States. In particular, we lead hands-on, technical workshops that focus on leveraging Docker and Kubernetes for a successful DevOps workflow.</p>

<p>As a cloud agnostic organisation, CloudOps partners with various platforms. The hands-on labs in our workshops are offered in GCP, Azure, AWS, or OpenStack depending on the specific needs of a given organization or individual. Our workshops help deploy agile and scalable containerized applications in multi-cloud environments.</p>

<p>CloudOps’ position as a KTP is an attestation of our dedication to contribute to the thriving Kubernetes ecosystem.
