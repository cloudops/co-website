<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The inaugural FT Americas ranking comes at a perilous and uncertain time for many companies, as the coronavirus severely curtails economies, workforces and ultimately growth. Yet the ranking also highlights 500 businesses across the continent for whom innovation and creativity have paid off — attributes that will underpin resilience and enable many of them to thrive once the worst effects of the pandemic are behind them.”</p><p><cite>Maxine Kelly, Commissioning Editor, Special Reports at Financial Times</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Out of the millions of active companies in North and South America, only 500 firms were awarded in the list, and CloudOps is pleased to be recognized as one of the FT’s inaugural list of The Americas’ Fastest Growing Companies 2020.</p>
