<p>We are pleased to announce that CloudOps and NetApp have solidified a partnership that will provide all-flash, multi-tiered storage for our IaaS portal, <a href="https://www.cloudops.com/cloudmc/" target="_blank">CloudMC</a>. CloudMC is CloudOps’ software for productizing and delivering cloud resources for telcos and shared services providers. The goal of having such high quality storage as part of our solution is to facilitate scalability, performance, and QoS for organizations leveraging CloudMC to monetize their cloud offering. The key advantages are APIs and automation to make the integration rapid and seamless.</p>

<p>In addition to adding value to our software portal, the partnership also benefits <a href="https://cloud.ca" target="_blank">cloud.ca</a>, a Canadian cloud service provider. The speed at which regions and clusters can be deployed, as well as the variety of performance tiers makes NetApp SolidFire an easy choice for this DevOps-friendly cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>“NetApp SolidFire has wholeheartedly committed to creating and maintaining integrations with open source projects such as Apache CloudStack, OpenStack, Docker and Kubernetes, which is key to our values,” says Marc Paré, Chief Commercial Officer at CloudOps. “NetApp gives our customers the ability to leverage persistent storage for containers, run multi-tenant and multi-tier storage services.”</p>
