<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CloudOps CEO, Ian Rae, was featured in KPMG Canada’s quarterly edition of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Next Million</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a magazine about Canadian entrepreneurship. The issue’s theme is cloud computing and companies that have successfully leveraged the cloud to scale their software applications, e-commerce sites, and employee mobility. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rae, as a leading figure in the Canadian and international cloud computing space, is being called a “cloud creator.” &nbsp;He founded CloudOps ten years ago and the company has tripled in size in the last three years. “What drew me to the cloud was the ability to reserve the right to not know exactly what you’re going to need in six months,” says Rae. CloudOps recently launched </span><a href="https://cloud.ca" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud.ca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 100% Canadian owned and operated Infrastructure as a Service, which Rae hopes will help Canadian companies more easily adopt cloud technologies to gain (and maintain) a competitive advantage. Rae and CloudOps are profiled alongside other heavy hitters in the cloud industry such as Shopify, Hootsuite, Global Relay and Achievers.</span></p>
