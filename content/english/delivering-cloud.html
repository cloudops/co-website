                <p>Today’s telecom service providers are looking for new ways to grow revenue. Meanwhile, the enterprise
                    service market has a growing need for integrated commercial offerings that include: edge computing,
                    cloud native technologies, hybrid multi-cloud infrastructures, data sovereign storage solutions,
                    SD-WAN, and more.</p>
                <p>CloudOps enables telecoms to build off their existing resources and strengths and go-to-market

                    revenue per customer, boost margins, gain market share, and avoid the network-as-a-commodity trap.

                <h2>Build - Consulting</h2>
                <p>Most telecoms lack the internal skill set to deliver new, timely, and differentiated cloud and
                    network service offerings.</p>
                <p>Our Delivering Cloud consulting services are one way that we partner with telecoms and managed
                    service providers to fill this gap. We plan and quickly implement a go-to-market strategy for these
                    new offerings while leveraging existing infrastructure assets.</p>
                <p>Telecoms can build off our existing service offerings (white-label or co-brand) and make use of
                    CloudOps’ solution architects, certified in multiple clouds and cloud native tech. We help qualify
                    and secure opportunities, and deliver B2B services to the market with a simple and consistent
                    experience.</p>
                <p>With our Delivering Cloud consulting service, telecoms can validate their market proposition quickly
                    and effectively, while maintaining margins for long-term profitability.</p>

                    ready, allow them to fully take over delivery and operations. The end result is that telecoms can
                    own their destiny in the cloud™</p>
                <p>CloudOps offers <a href="/managed-services-augmented-support">Augmented Support</a> that acts as a

                    multi-vendor solutions and helps telecoms and their enterprise users succeed with the transition to
                    an “as-a-service” economy.</p>
                <p>CloudMC is an API-driven, modular and extensible, edge orchestration platform that enables service
                    providers to deliver, operate and monetize cloud and network services with a seamless cross-platform
