<p><strong>As Citrix launches its new partner specialist program, CloudOps receives prestigious designation</strong></p>

<p>MONTREAL – CloudOps, a&nbsp;cloud solutions provider and Citrix Gold Partner, announces its most recent Citrix certification as a Networking for Data Centre specialist. The specialization provides a framework for partners to demonstrate technical competency, end-to-end sales capability and service delivery expertise.</p>

<p>The new certification program was announced in early 2015 and allows for a partner to highlight their investments and expertise in a solutions category; virtualization, mobility, or networking. We&nbsp;chose the Networking for Data Centre category, which involves optimizing, securing and controlling the delivery of services built on Citrix NetScaler and Citrix CloudBridge, supporting the efficient delivery of applications over any network, from enterprise data centres to cloud providers. The specialist designation means that we are&nbsp;recognized as being qualified with specific, in-depth knowledge and proven implementations of these highly technical solutions.</p>

<p>Under the new program, Citrix enhanced their certification process for the specialist designations, requiring three or more employees to hold certifications and participate in e-learning courses, and also three customer validations and a practicum (new for this level). These additional requirements assure that specialist partners master the technical knowledge in addition to delivering customer satisfaction and practical know-how that are involved with cloud networking deployments. This designation underscores our status as a top solutions provider for complex network infrastructures and as an expert in NetScalers for enterprise data centres, private clouds, Amazon Web Services or cloud.ca. All these solutions are supported by 24×7 managed Application Delivery Controller services.</p>

<p>“We are very proud of being the first Citrix partner in Canada to obtain this designation,” says Ian Rae, CloudOps’ CEO. “We have been working with Citrix since 2007 to deliver great cloud platform and cloud networking solutions to our customers. The Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller is a key component of today’s enterprise IT architecture and we look forward to working alongside Citrix to deliver its value to our customers.”</p>
