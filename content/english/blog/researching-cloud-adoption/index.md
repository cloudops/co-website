<p>It’s been a few years since clouds were new. Today, utility computing is a tool in the IT toolbox, and it consists of both on-premise and on-demand components. We have strong private stacks (Cloud Platform, OpenStack, Eucalyptus, VMWare and others) and a variety of large-scale public providers at both the IaaS (Amazon, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace) and PaaS (Cloud Foundry, Openshift, App Engine, Heroku) level.</p>

<p>Yet there are still plenty of reasons why companies fail to embrace clouds, from governance and compliance concerns to questions around performance and cost. When we ask, we get different answers from small startups, big web businesses, and traditional enterprise IT.</p>

<p>So we’re going to survey the market. Since we launched the survey last week, we’ve received over a hundred responses from companies of all sizes. We’d like to get several times that total before we crunch the data. We don’t just want a simple survey report—rather, we want to analyze the relationship between company size, business model, cloud platform choice, and areas of concern.</p>

<p>We’ll publish the study for free once it’s completed, and we’ll only release aggregate data from our analysis about ten minutes to complete. You can also help us by telling your network about the study and urging others to participate.</p>
