<h3><strong>The fight is over, and Software-As-A-Service won.</strong> Software companies that wait too long to move to an on-demand model lose market share, and quickly grow out of touch with their customers.</h3><p>Those are some pretty bold statements…especially if you are an ISV.</p><p><strong>THE JOURNEY FROM ISV TO ASP TO SAAS</strong></p><p>Since the dawn of computing, there has always been a&nbsp;tension between centralized computing and computing&nbsp;at the edge. Mainframes were centrally managed,&nbsp;but as processing became cheaper, they gave way to&nbsp;minicomputers and servers.</p><p>One reason for this was the high cost of bandwidth—as&nbsp;Microsoft’s Jim Gray once remarked, “compared to the&nbsp;cost of moving bits around, everything else is free.” So&nbsp;companies ran those servers near end users.</p><p>This proximity came at a cost, however. The companies&nbsp;bought packaged software, which they tailored to&nbsp;their own needs and ran themselves. That caused&nbsp;fragmentation, so software vendors had to support a&nbsp;wide range of versions and deployments at the same&nbsp;time, reducing their ability to innovate.</p><p>To address this, in the late nineties a number of&nbsp;Application Service Providers emerged. Their offering was&nbsp;reminiscent of the managed IT services that IBM, EDS,&nbsp;CGI and others had offered in the past, but it included the&nbsp;operation—and sometimes ownership—of the server and&nbsp;application stack. They ran software someone else made,&nbsp;and tried to streamline operations.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was still a tremendous variety in&nbsp;client software. These ASPs had to contend with the twin&nbsp;horsemen of client sprawl and a stalled dot-com market,&nbsp;and many of them failed. But they weren’t wrong—just&nbsp;early.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new generation of software companies&nbsp;built with only the web in mind. Salesforce.com, Taleo,&nbsp;Netsuite and others drew a different dividing line&nbsp;between themselves and their customers, choosing to&nbsp;own the entire software stack rather than license it from&nbsp;others. Borrowing a page from Henry Ford, customers&nbsp;could have any version of the software they wanted—&nbsp;as long as it was the current one, delivered by them,&nbsp;accessed through a web browser.</p><p><strong>And so the Software-as-a-Service market was born.</strong></p><h3><a href="/resources/white-papers/road-to-saas/">Learn more about the journey down the Road to SaaS in the CloudOps Whitepaper.</a></h3><p><a href="/resources/white-papers/road-to-saas/"><img style="width: 230px;" src="/images/blog/post/Download-Whitepaper-CTA.png"></a></p>
