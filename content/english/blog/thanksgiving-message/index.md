<h2>These remain extraordinary times.</h2>

<p>We are seeing a resurgence of outbreaks of COVID-19 in Canada, with Quebec leading the numbers. Looking back I am proud of the prudence we took in not returning to our offices, as difficult as it is to miss our beautiful new offices, terrace, and beehive. And most of all we are missing the opportunity to work face-to-face with our people.</p>

<p>As difficult as these circumstances have been for us, our families, and our communities, we are so incredibly lucky to be focused on solving problems that are more relevant than ever, and also that we are able to work very effectively despite the new work-from-home reality. I am both impressed by and grateful for the extent to which our team of teams has stepped up to support our customers and each other. I am also extremely proud that we have doubled down on investments to support our people. Thanks in particular to our People team for their outstanding support and resilience, you are deeply appreciated.</p>

<p>I want to recognize that around us the world is experiencing and will continue to experience significant turmoil and that this has ripple effects everywhere. This is a time when our ability to work together as teams and our team of teams is more important than ever, on top of the critical foundation supporting the “CloudOps Way”, our values:</p>

<ol>
  <li>People</li>
  <li>Teamwork</li>
  <li>Continuous Improvement</li>
  <li>Communication</li>
</ol>

<p>While it is a strange time for the market in so many ways, one signal is clear: “the cloud” has never been more attractive. We are incredibly lucky to find ourselves so relevant to the present and future of the economy, and our mission to help customers “own their destiny” has taken on a new urgency because in this crisis the stakes are even higher. With so many options and so much market pressure to adopt, our job to understand the customer’s needs and to be their trusted advisor, enabling and accompanying them on a safe, and efficient journey in the clouds is more relevant than ever. You should all feel very proud of contributing to and supporting our key capabilities, which independently are very capable but come together in exponentially more powerful “Voltron” solutions that support success in our “infinite game”.</p>

<p>So, as we have so much to give thanks for, and as I feel extremely lucky to be able to work with all of you, I wanted to wish you a very happy Canadian Thanksgiving! Many thanks!</p>
