<div><h2>Software-Defined, Automated, Shared Storage Infrastructure Made Accessible to Open Source CloudStack Community<p></p></h2><h2></h2></div>

<p><b>CloudOps’ Expertise</b></p>

<p>Since 2005, CloudOps has focused on delivering vendor-agnostic cloud services with open source at its core. Companies who wish to take advantage of cloud infrastructure for various reasons including agility, elasticity, reliability, and right-sizing of infrastructure have benefitted greatly from CloudOps’ technical and business expertise in delivering cloud solutions.</p>

<p>Apache CloudStack (ACS) has been a major part of CloudOps’ open source IaaS offering to companies who wish to create both private and public cloud deployments. Its employees have contributed to the CloudStack community with a number of valuable submissions* and have acted in numerous roles including VP of Apache CloudStack and 4.9 Release Manager in 2016 (Will Stevens), seats on the PMC (Will Stevens and Pierre-Luc Dion), and Committers (Will Stevens, Pierre-Luc Dion, and Syed Ahmed).</p>

<p>With all this community involvement and technical expertise, Datera, a provider of elastic storage for on-premises clouds, sought CloudOps’ help in building the integration for ACS. CloudOps developed the code for the plug-in, enabling Datera’s storage-as-a-service offering which includes fast snapshots, IOPS and bandwidth QoS controls, support for volume placement across hybrid and flash nodes, and template-based provisioning.</p>

<p><b>Benefits of Datera Elastic Data Fabric (EDF) Integration with ACS</b></p>

<p>“Datera offers a unique feature set at an attractive price point, giving CloudStack users a wide variety of options when choosing the appropriate storage for their application workload” states Will Stevens, CTO at CloudOps and 2016 VP of Apache CloudStack.</p>

<p>Datera offers enterprise-class performance combined with the simplicity and agility of hyperscale clouds – all on-premises.</p>

<p>Ashok Rajagopalan, Head of Products at Datera, points out three major benefits of their offering:</p>

<div><ol style="font-size:90%"><li>The ability to create unique storage service tiers for <a href="http://www.datera.io/blog/data-is-currency/" target="_blank"> various types of applications.</a></li><li>Decoupling physical infrastructure and logical provisioning enabling the advantages of newer generation hardware and media as they are released.</li><li>Significantly simplify storage operations through a self-adaptive design, complemented  with a cloud-based AI-driven engine, all provided through an API-first architecture.</li></ol></div>

<p><b>API-First Data Architecture</b></p>

<p>Datera Elastic Data Fabric’s API-first architecture unlocks the power of software-driven control and policy-driven operations. The API is the access point for all orchestrators, such as ACS, to manage the EDF through policies. Datera’s self-adaptive system constantly evolves to meet the changing needs of applications and the data centre infrastructure.</p>

<p>Datera EDF fundamentally helps defragment the data centre from silos, support a wide variety of applications at multiple service levels, and delivering automation at scale. This helps optimize cloud operations and economics with enterprise capabilities and performance.</p>
