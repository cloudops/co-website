<p>Today we added a setup guide to the official Apache CloudStack documentation for the new features we developed to integrate the Palo Alto Networks firewall into CloudStack as a service provider.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/latest/adminguide/networking/palo_alto_config.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out the documentation…</a></p>

<p>Start taking advantage of the Palo Alto Networks firewall orchestration in CloudStack by following the simple setup guide. Once the initial setup is done, CloudStack takes over and does all of the orchestration of the firewall.</p>

<p>This integration supports the following features:</p>

<div class="tabbed-text">
<p>Source NAT Management
<div class="tabbed-text">
<p>Manage the Source NAT IPs</p>
<p>Manage the private gateway of the guest networks</p>
<p>Manage the Source NAT rules</p>
</div>
</p>
<p>Firewall rule management
<div class="tabbed-text">
<p>Supports both Ingress and Egress firewall rules</p>
<p>Supports both ‘Allow’ and ‘Deny’ default Egress rules</p>
</div>
</p>
<p>Static NAT management</p>
<p>Port Forwarding management</p>
<p>Public IP provisioning</p>
<p>Guest network isolation</p>
<p>Threat Profile management</p>
<p>Log Forwarding management</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the standard features that CloudStack offers, this integration also adds two additional features to take advantage of the unique power of the Palo Alto Networks firewall. The ability to add a Threat Profile and/or a Log Forwarding profile to all the allow firewall rules configured on the device makes this integration special. One of the main issues with the built in CloudStack virtual router is the fact that you have absolutely no visibility into the traffic flowing over your network. The addition of the Threat Profile gives you a lot more visibility into your network’s traffic and allows you to easily detect malicious behavior. The Log Forwarding functionality gives you a lot of flexibility in consuming the logs generated by the firewall so you can stay in the loop.</p>

<p>We are very excited to be able to offer this functionality and make it available to the community. &nbsp;If you have questions, please feel free to reach out to us.</p>
