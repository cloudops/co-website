<p>The second edition of DevOpsDays Montreal took place on November 5 and 6. CloudOps was excited to be at this event which brought together community members from across Eastern Canada in celebration of all things DevOps. The two days were jam-packed with talks in both English and French, open spaces, and workshops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first day started with a talk by Richard Fontana called “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O4y6WqAP3Q&amp;list=PL2tIJL4fCPDPMBfGvLOixlCfqRv9OgIvZ&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s" target="_blank">Open Source: Everything’s fine</a>,” an interesting look into the legalities of open source software. Christian Couder then presented “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoOvBhkdqbU&amp;list=PL2tIJL4fCPDPMBfGvLOixlCfqRv9OgIvZ&amp;index=3" target="_blank">Qualité et agilité avec Git</a>,” where he spoke about how Git has enabled GitHub and GitLab to continue serving open source communities. Catherine Proulx presented “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kQV4rUUVMM&amp;list=PL2tIJL4fCPDPMBfGvLOixlCfqRv9OgIvZ&amp;index=1" target="_blank">DevOps for Pyromaniac Kittens (a.k.a. researchers)</a>” and focused on the ongoing implementation of a DevOps process in a real research lab, from a human perspective. Chuck Mountz Jr presented “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9RH1x3n0Q&amp;list=PL2tIJL4fCPDPMBfGvLOixlCfqRv9OgIvZ&amp;index=2" target="_blank">Creating a Personal North Star: Taking ownership of your career path</a>.” Martin Deslongchamps then presented “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqwMKo5QlHg&amp;list=PL2tIJL4fCPDPMBfGvLOixlCfqRv9OgIvZ&amp;index=5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Étude de cas: Agile et DevOps chez Croesus</a>.” These talks were punctuated by lunch and coffee breaks.</p>

<p>The afternoon continued with a series of open space workshops, where attendees could meet and discuss all kinds of specialized topics, and then guided workshops. James, or purplidea, led a workshop on mgmt config, and Gareth Greenway led a workshop called “Dr SaltStack: Replaced all the Crons.” The first day concluded with a drinks reception.</p>

<p>Day 2 of DevOpsDays Montreal began with a keynote by Steve Pereira called “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JjhwubHFyo&amp;list=PL2tIJL4fCPDPMBfGvLOixlCfqRv9OgIvZ&amp;index=7" target="_blank">Time for What’s Next</a>,” which explained how value stream mapping can improve team processes. Yannick Brosseau presented “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgzLYnSvV-w&amp;list=PL2tIJL4fCPDPMBfGvLOixlCfqRv9OgIvZ&amp;index=9" target="_blank">Your Hardware is Still Mostly Software: Handling firmwares in your fleet</a>,” a reminder that embedded software parts often require more attention than they were given. A series of Ignite talks, where speakers had 5 minutes, were followed by a talk by Philippe Lafoucrière called “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPXfe-u2jXU&amp;list=PL2tIJL4fCPDPMBfGvLOixlCfqRv9OgIvZ&amp;index=6" target="_blank">Fermer la boucle DevSecOps</a>,” which showed how security processes should be integrated into development cycles. Charles Abondo had put some of those ideas into practice and gave a talk called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOUuI6rB1Kw&amp;list=PL2tIJL4fCPDPMBfGvLOixlCfqRv9OgIvZ&amp;index=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Technology in Motion: The DevSecOps journey at CN</a>.” After more open spaces, the learning concluded with two more workshops. Christian Couder led a workshop on advanced Git tips and Steve Pereira on flow engineering. The second day was packed full as well.</p>
