General Statement of Privacy and Protection of Personal Information
CloudOps takes your privacy and security of Personal Information very seriously. We have provided and will continue to provide a secure environment and this strict Policy that describes the limited ways the information is used and the limited access to such information.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Policy covers the treatment of personally-identifiable information, i.e. any information that identifies an individual or Legal Entity, or can be used in conjunction with other information to identify an individual or Legal Entity (“Personal Information”) and other information gathered by CloudOps when you are visiting the Website and / or using the Services. This Policy also covers CloudOps’ treatment of any Personal Information that CloudOps may share with its business partners or other third parties under very limited circumstances.
This Policy does not apply to the general practices and treatment of information (whether personal or not) by third parties that CloudOps does not own or control, including but not limited to any third-party websites or services that you elect to access through the Website or Services or via a link from the Website or Services (“Third-Party Website”), or to individuals that CloudOps does not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access or link only to those Third-Party Websites that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third-Party Websites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Website you access. We have named and provided links to the most important of these Third-Party Websites elsewhere in this Policy.
Finally, this Policy does not cover any Personal Information you send to CloudOps via any non-secured, non-encrypted mode of communications such as email, instant messenger or other messaging service, or Twitter or any other social media, as communications via these methods may be subject to interception, loss, or alteration. While we welcome your comments and suggestions sent to us in this manner, we encourage you to carefully examine what Personal Information you send to CloudOps via these methods.
No Collection of Personal Information as a Matter of Course
CloudOps does not, as a matter of course, gather any of your Personal Information while you are visiting the Website or are using the Services, unless you are asked to provide such information. Personal Information is only gathered with your informed consent. Where you have provided Personal Information, it will only be used for the stated purpose.
Personal Information We May Collect and Its Uses
The following is a list of the types of Personal Information we may collect from you. You acknowledge and agree that you are submitting this Personal Information with your informed consent.
“Contact Information”: If you contact us, you may be submitting your name, phone number, email address or other information. We use this Contact Information only for the purposes of responding to your inquiry, and contacting you about CloudOps Services and other matters which may be of interest to you.
“Account Information”: Certain users of the Services will require certain information to create an account. This Account Information is used to manage your account, to verify your credentials for logging-in to the Services, to communicate with you information about your account, and to communicate with you information about the Website or Services.
Security and Encryption of Information
CloudOps uses only industry best practices (physical, electronic and procedural) in keeping any data collected secure. In addition, CloudOps may use third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate the Services, and these third parties have been selected for their high standards of security, both electronic and physical. Please note that these third parties may not be located in your home jurisdiction – please see the “Transfer of Personal Information Outside Your Home Jurisdiction” section further in this Policy for more information.
Where you use the Services and Website, all information is transferred by encrypted Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”), the standard for Internet secure transactions and data transmission.
Non-disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties
Except as provided in the next paragraphs, CloudOps does not divulge any Personal Information gathered via the Services to third parties. Moreover, CloudOps does not sell, rent, trade or license any Personal Information regarding its users to third parties. Only the employees, representatives, subcontractors, officers, agents, or assigns of CloudOps are responsible for the management and development of the Website and Services, and only these individuals have access to the information collected there. These employees, representatives, subcontractors, officers, agents or assigns all have been instructed to comply with the Policy, and are under contractual or legal obligations of non-disclosure.
Notwithstanding anything in the Policy to the contrary, we may share any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted (whether Personal Information or not): (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims or demands; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or any violation of any agreement between you and CloudOps; (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve abuse of the Website or Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of the Website or Services infrastructure or the Website or Services generally); (4) to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with CloudOps (in which case we will require such entities to honour this Policy); (5) if CloudOps merges with another entity, is subject to a corporate reorganization, or sells or transfers all or part of its business, assets or shares (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Policy, or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy).

Your IP address and other relevant information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity, or any activity in violation of an agreement between you and CloudOps.
Aggregated Information
In addition to the information collected by the analytics program as described in the previous section, we may also generate, use and disclose aggregated and / or anonymized information and statistics about the Services and Website for marketing and strategic purposes. However, no user of our Website or Services will be individually identifiable from these aggregated and / or anonymized information and statistics.

CloudOps shall not be held responsible for any function that may not operate after you refuse or delete cookies, or any losses or damages, pecuniary or otherwise, arising from those functions not operating, or having reduced functionality.
Risks Associated with the Internet and Wireless Data Transmission
Despite CloudOps’ best efforts to ensure that third parties will not access or obtain your Personal Information through your use of the Website or Services, complete confidentiality and security cannot currently be guaranteed on the Internet and / or where data is transferred via digital wireless technology of any type.

Limitation of Liability
CloudOps will not be held liable for any losses or damages (pecuniary or otherwise) resulting from the misuse of any information collected by any third party, or any misuse of any information collected through the Website or Services or via other means not in violation of the Policy.
