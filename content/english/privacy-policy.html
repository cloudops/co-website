            <h2>General Statement of Privacy and Protection of Personal Information</h2>
            <p>CloudOps takes your privacy and security of Personal Information very seriously. 
                We have provided a secure environment 
                and this strict Policy that describes the limited ways the information is used 
                and the limited access to such information.</p>

            <h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
            <p>This Policy covers the treatment of personally-identifiable information, 
                i.e. any information that identifies an individual or Legal Entity or 
                can be used in conjunction with other information to identify an individual 
                or Legal Entity (<b>“Personal Information”</b>), when you voluntarily submit 
                this information and other information gathered by CloudOps when you are using 
                or accessing the Website. This Policy also covers CloudOps’ treatment of 
                any Personal Information that CloudOps may share with its business partners 
                or other third parties under very limited circumstances. </p>

            <p>This Policy does not apply to the general practices and treatment of information 
                (whether personal or not) by third parties that CloudOps does not own or control, 
                including but not limited to any third-party websites or services that you elect 
                to access through the Website or via a link from the Website (<b>“Third-Party Website”</b>), 
                or to individuals that CloudOps does not manage or employ. While we attempt 
                to facilitate access or link only to those Third-Party Websites that share our respect 
                for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies 
                of those Third-Party Websites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies 
                of any Third-Party Website you access.</p>

            <p>Finally, this Policy does not cover any Personal Information you send to CloudOps 
                via any non-secured mode of communications such as email, Facebook or Twitter, 
                as communications via these methods may be subject to interception, loss, or alteration. 
                While we welcome your comments and suggestions sent to us in this manner, 
                we encourage you to carefully examine what Personal Information you send to CloudOps 
                via these methods.</p>
            <h3>No Collection of Personal Information as a Matter of Course</h3>
            <p>CloudOps does not, as a matter of course, gather any of your Personal Information 
                while you are visiting the Website, unless you are asked to provide such information, 
                for example by submitting information through a contact form. 
                Personal Information is only gathered with your informed consent. 
                Where you have provided Personal Information, it will only be used for 
                the stated purpose or use, as described in the next section of this Policy.
            </p>

            <h3>Personal Information Collected and its Uses</h3>
            <p>The following is an exhaustive list of Personal Information collected from you 
                when you use the Website and what we use it for. You acknowledge that 
                you are submitting this Personal Information with your informed consent. 
                When you submit Personal Information about the Legal Entity you represent, 
                you represent and warrant that you have the capacity and authority to submit 
                such Personal Information on their behalf.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>“Contact Information”</b>:  If you fill out any of our contact forms on the Website, 
                    you will be asked for Personal Information such as your name, company name, address, 
                    phone number, and email address. We only use this Contact Information to respond 
                    to your inquiry or request, and to send you more information if applicable, 
                    such as a white paper you have requested. </li>
                <li><b>“Chat / Message Information”</b>:  If you use our online chat services, 
                    you will be asked to enter Personal Information including your name, email,

                    or further communicate with you (if necessary) after a live chat session. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Security of Information</h2>
           
            <p>CloudOps uses only industry best practices (physical, electronic and procedural) 
                 keeping any data collected secure. In addition, CloudOps may use third-party 
                 vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, 
                 storage, and related technology required to operate the Services, 
                 and these third parties have been selected for their high standards of security, 
                 both electronic and physical. Your Contact Information is stored by a third party, 
                 Hubspot, who are contractually required to keep your information secure and 
                 not share it with any other third party. Your Chat / Message Information is 
                 stored by a third party, Zendesk, who are contractually required to keep your 
                 information secure and not share it with any other third party. 
                 Please note that these third parties may not be located in your home jurisdiction – 
                 please see the “Transfer of Personal Information Outside Your Home Jurisdiction” 
                 section further in this Policy for more information.</p>
            
            <p>Where you use the Services and Website, all information is transferred by encrypted 
                Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”), 
                the standard for Internet secure transactions and data transmission.</p>

            <h2>Non-disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</h2>
            <p>Except as provided in the previous section in this Policy on Security of Information, 
                the next paragraphs of this section, and the next section in this Policy on Email Communication, 
                CloudOps does not divulge any Personal Information gathered via the Website to third parties. 
                Moreover, CloudOps does not sell, rent, trade license or otherwise transfer any 
                Personal Information regarding its Website visitors or users to third parties. 
                Only the employees, agents, subcontractors, officers, directors, or assigns of CloudOps 
                (or of CloudOps’ affiliates) are responsible for the management and development of the Website, 
                and only these individuals have access to the information collected there. 
                These employees, agents, subcontractors, officers, directors or assigns all have been 
                instructed to comply with the Policy.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding anything in the Policy to the contrary, we may share any information we have 
                collected about you or that you have submitted: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, 
                or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against 
                legal claims or demands; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, 
                or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats 
                to the safety of any person, or any violation of any other agreement you may have with CloudOps; 
                (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations 
                that involve abuse of the Website infrastructure or the Internet in general 
                (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security 
                of the Website infrastructure or the Website generally); (4) to a parent company, subsidiaries, 
                joint ventures, or other companies under common control with CloudOps (in which case we will 
                require such entities to honour this Policy); (5) if CloudOps merges with another entity, 
                is subject to a corporate reorganisation, or sells or transfers all or part of our business, 
                assets, or shares (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations 
                under this Policy, or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy).</p>

            <p>Where you share or like content from the Website via social media such as your Facebook, 
                Google+, LinkedIn or Twitter (“Third-Party Service”) account, we may transfer Personal 
                Information to the Third-Party Service (your Third-Party Service login credentials) 
                if you are not already logged-in to the Third-Party Service on the computer or device 
                being used. Your Personal Information is transferred securely and only used in order to 
                share or like the Website content. </p>

            <h2>Email Communications and Compliance with Anti-Spam Laws</h2>
            <p>CloudOps currently uses Hubspot to send out emails. 
                Personal Information is transferred to Hubspot in order for 
                our email communications to function properly. 
                Your Personal Information is only used for the proper sending out of email; 
                Hubspot does not use this Personal Information for any other purpose 
                and will not transfer or sell your Personal Information to any other third party. 
                You may unsubscribe from receiving marketing emails from us at 
                any time by following the link at the bottom of any email sent to you.</p>
            <p>CloudOps’ practices with regards to its email practices are designed to be compliant 
                with anti-spam laws, specifically the law unofficially called “CASL”, or Canada’s Anti-Spam Law. 
                If you believe you have received email in violation of this law, 
                lease contact us using the contact information further up in this Policy.</p>
            
            <h2>Limited Gathering of Information for Statistical, Analytical and Security Purposes</h2>
            <p>CloudOps automatically collects certain information using third-party analytics programs 
                Google Analytics  and Hubspot (the “Analytics Programs”) to help us understand 
                how our users use the Website, but none of this information identifies you personally. 
                For example, each time you visit the Website, we may automatically collect your IP address, 
                browser and computer type, access times, the web page from which you came, 
                and the web page(s) you access (as applicable). We use information collected via 
                the Analytics Programs in this manner only to better understand your needs and 
                the needs of the Website and its users in the aggregate CloudOps also makes use 
                of information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of 
                visits to the Website and the specific pages on the Website with a view 
                to introducing improvements. </p>
            <p>Your IP address and other relevant information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity, 
                or any activity in violation of any other agreement you may have with CloudOps.</p>

                (iii) withdraw your consent to the use by CloudOps of your Personal Information 
                and have it deleted from our records. If you wish to inquire about and verify and / or 
                correct Personal Information CloudOps holds about you, or if you wish to have 
                all your Personal Information permanently deleted from our records, 
                please contact us using the contact information further up in this Policy.

                for you to use the Website, or certain portions thereof including but not limited 
                to your free trial. If you request deletion of your Personal Information, 
                CloudOps reserves the right to retain some of your Personal Information for a 
                reasonable time in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where 
                we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.</p>
