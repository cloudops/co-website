            <h2>General Statement of Privacy and Protection of Personal Information</h2>
            <p>CloudOps takes your privacy and security of Personal Information very seriously. We have provided and
                will continue
                to
                provide a secure environment and this strict Policy that describes the limited ways the information is
                used and the
                limited access to such information.</p>

            <h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
            <p>This Policy covers the treatment of personally-identifiable information, i.e. any information that
                identifies an
                individual or Legal Entity, or can be used in conjunction with other information to identify an
                individual or Legal
                Entity (“Personal Information”) and other information gathered by CloudOps when you are visiting the
                Website and /
                or
                using the Services. This Policy also covers CloudOps’ treatment of any Personal Information that
                CloudOps may share
                with
                its business partners or other third parties under very limited circumstances.</p>
            <p>This Policy does not apply to the general practices and treatment of information (whether personal or
                not) by third
                parties that CloudOps does not own or control, including but not limited to any third-party websites or
                services
                that you elect to access through the Website or Services or via a link from the Website or Services
                (“Third-Party
                Website”), or to individuals that CloudOps does not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate
                access or link
                only
                to those Third-Party Websites that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for
                the content
                or
                privacy policies of those Third-Party Websites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy
                policies of any
                Third-Party Website you access. We have named and provided links to the most important of these
                Third-Party Websites
                elsewhere in this Policy.</p>
            <p>Finally, this Policy does not cover any Personal Information you send to CloudOps via any non-secured,
                non-encrypted
                mode
                of communications such as email, instant messenger or other messaging service, or Twitter or any other
                social media,
                as
                communications via these methods may be subject to interception, loss, or alteration. While we welcome
                your comments
                and
                suggestions sent to us in this manner, we encourage you to carefully examine what Personal Information
                you send to
                CloudOps via these methods.</p>
            <h3>No Collection of Personal Information as a Matter of Course</h3>
            <p>CloudOps does not, as a matter of course, gather any of your Personal Information while you are visiting
                the Website
                or
                are using the Services, unless you are asked to provide such information. Personal Information is only

            </ul>

            <h2>Security and Encryption of Information</h2>
            <p>CloudOps uses only industry best practices (physical, electronic and procedural) in keeping any data
                collected secure.</p>
            <p>In addition, CloudOps may use third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware,
                software,
                networking, storage, and related technology required to operate the Services, and these third parties
                have been selected
                for their high standards of security, both electronic and physical. Please note that these third parties
                may not be
                located in your home jurisdiction – please see the “Transfer of Personal Information Outside Your Home
                Jurisdiction”
                section further in this Policy for more information.</p>
            <p>Where you use the Services and Website, all information is transferred by encrypted Secure Sockets Layer
                (“SSL”), the
                standard for Internet secure transactions and data transmission.</p>
            <h2>Non-disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</h2>
            <p>Except as provided in the next paragraphs, CloudOps does not divulge any Personal Information gathered
                via the Services

                regarding its users
                to third parties. Only the employees, representatives, subcontractors, officers, agents, or assigns of
                CloudOps are
                responsible for the management and development of the Website and Services, and only these individuals
                have access to
                the information collected there. These employees, representatives, subcontractors, officers, agents or
                assigns all have
                been instructed to comply with the Policy, and are under contractual or legal obligations of
                non-disclosure.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding anything in the Policy to the contrary, we may share any information we have collected
                about you or that
                you have submitted (whether Personal Information or not):</p>

            <ol>
                <li>in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our
                    legal rights or
                    defend against legal claims or demands;</li>
                <li>if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
                    activities, fraud,
                    or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or any violation of any
                    agreement between you
                    and CloudOps;</li>
                <li>if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that
                    involve abuse of the
                    Website or Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial
                    of service attacks,
                    or attempts to compromise the security of the Website or Services infrastructure or the Website or
                    Services generally);</li>
                <li>to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with
                    CloudOps (in which
                    case we will require such entities to honour this Policy);</li>
                <li>if CloudOps merges with another entity, is subject to a corporate reorganization, or sells or
                    transfers all or part of
                    its business, assets or shares (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations
                    under this Policy,
                    or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy).
            </ol>

            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>CloudOps currently uses Google AdWords and Display Network and by using the Services or Website you
                consent to this use.
                Specifically, CloudOps uses the remarketing features of interest-based advertising of Google AdWords
                that delivers you
                advertisements that will be of particular interest to you, based on your browsing and activity history
                at the Website.
                These advertisements will appear on third-party websites around the web. Google uses specific cookies to
                allow them to
                serve these ads around the web.</p>
            <p>You may prevent this type of advertising by deleting the appropriate Google cookie through your browser,
                though this may
                not be permanent. For a more permanent solution, you may opt out of such Google advertising by following
                Google’s
                instructions.</p>
            <p>CloudOps may also use other forms of advertising now or in the future, and by using the Website or
                Services you consent
                to such use.</p>
            <h2>Compliance with Anti-Spam Laws</h2>
            <p>CloudOps’ practices in regards to its email are designed to be compliant with anti-spam laws,
                specifically the law
                unofficially called “CASL”, or Canada’s Anti-Spam Law (S.C. 2010, c. 23). If you believe you have
                received email in
                violation of this law, please contact us using the contact information further up in this Policy.</p>

            <h2>Limited Gathering of Information for Statistical, Analytical and Security Purposes</h2>
            <p>CloudOps automatically collects certain information using the third-party analytics programs, to help us
                understand how
                our users use the Website or Services, but none of this information identifies you personally. For
                example, each time
                you visit the Website or use the Services, we automatically collect (as applicable) your IP address,

                understand your needs
                and the needs of the Website and Services users in the aggregate. CloudOps also makes use of information
                gathered for
                statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Website, the specific pages on the
                Website, and users
                of the Services with a view to introducing improvements to the Website and Services.</p>
            <p>Your IP address and other relevant information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal
                activity, or any
                activity in violation of an agreement between you and CloudOps.</p>
            <h2>Aggregated Information</h2>
            <p>In addition to the information collected by the analytics program as described in the previous section,
