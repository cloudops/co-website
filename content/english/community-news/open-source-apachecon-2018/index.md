<p><a href="https://apachecon.com/acna18/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ApacheCon North America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was held in Montreal this year from September&nbsp;24<span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 27</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th.</span> The event featured a CloudStack Collab Conference, in which containers, DevOps, IoT, servers, and web frameworks amongst many other subjects were covered. CloudOps was pleased to sponsor the event, and even more so to participate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Syed Ahmed discussed&nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Journey to CloudStack&nbsp;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with Francois Nadeau from Ticketmaster, who partnered with CloudOps for help leveraging Infrastructure-as-a-Service. Our sisters company, cloud.ca, made a few presentations. Mike Gero discussed <em>How cloud.ca uses CloudStack.&nbsp;</em></span>Pierre-Luc Dion presented </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log and Metric Collection in Apache CloudStack.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Khosrow Moosavi presented </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CloudStack Integration with Vault by HashiCorp, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a key solution for enforcing secrets security. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Stevens and Marc Vaillancourt presented </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a Portal for Service Providers. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As CTO and Director of Products at CloudOps respectively, Will and Marc help organizations embrace open source, cloud native strategies that build on strong foundations of best practices and operational excellence. Will was CloudStack VP in 2016 and is actively involved in the community. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/CloudOps2005/cloudmc-building-a-portal-for-cloudstack-service-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their presentation</a> considered how&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cloudops.com/cloudmc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CloudMC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;can be used to&nbsp;create Infrastructure-as-Code on a variety of platforms, including Apache CloudStack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CloudMC is a business portal that enables service providers to monetize their offerings &nbsp;through a self-service portal for end users. The deployment and management is simple and the end-user experience multilingual and rich in features. It helps solve the difficulties that providers with large portfolios of services face as they strive to present end customers with a unified experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CloudMC provides a single pane of glass from which providers can deliver their products to market through either shallow or deep integrations. It offers a normalized API through its plug-in architecture that unifies diverse APIs of the underlying services and can be run on multi-cloud platforms. CloudMC’s extensible framework enables multi-cloud management through integrations with CloudStack, OpenStack, Public Clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) and other NFV integrations can be made available as needed. Ultimately, it helps providers deliver a tailored portfolio of services comprised of heterogeneous solutions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will and Marc’s presentation reviewed some key components of CloudMC’s architecture. It discussed how CloudMC can support multi-level and multi-tenant organizational structures that enable flexible resource management. CloudMC has white-label capabilities with a flexible billing model that can be based on utility or reserved pricing. The presentation shed insight on the rich features provided by CloudMC’s unified API, including usage reporting, RBAC, quotas, and activity logging. Altogether, the portal strengthens the security and governance of an environment’s management.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having organized and run the 2016 CloudStack Collab Conference, CloudOps was pleased to continue supporting </span><a href="https://www.apache.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Apache Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year. The Apache Foundation develops and incubates over 350 open source projects and initiatives across a wide range of technologies. It emphasises the importance of collaboration for software development in vendor-neutral environments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CloudOps believes strongly in the importance of open source for delivering future-proof solutions that optimize the way cloud services are delivered, consumed, and connected. &nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cloudops.com/cloudmc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here to read more about CloudMC.</span></a></p>
