      <description>DevOps is a combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. But it cannot be achieved simply by containerizing applications and hiring a few DevOps engineers. The adoption of bleeding-edge tools is not enough on its own to deliver the benefits of DevOps. This is especially true for today’s remote workforce. There are several mistakes that are all too common for organizations trying to adopt DevOps, but chief among them is the failure to properly structure teams.</description>

      <description>People leverage the cloud for many reasons. More often than not, the need to cut costs ranks high among them. And while the cloud does offer significant benefits that include cost-efficiency, some organizations have found out the hard way that this isn’t necessarily true as they scale. Cloud native infrastructures are complex entities that must be managed properly to scale cost-effectively. In this blog, we identify eight ways that can help your organization optimize its cloud usage.</description>

      <description>There are companies still talking about digital transformation in 2020, and you’re clearly behind the curve if you’re one of them. While the disparity between those who have gone digital and those who haven’t has been deepening for a while, it became obvious when COVID-19 forced us all to move our offices into our homes. The days of companies offering remote work as a luxury or something only to be used in extreme or rare circumstances are over.</description>

      <description>From the first day I started working as the office manager at CloudOps it felt like I was working from home all the time because that’s what CloudOps became to me; my second home. I immediately became friends with everybody at work. I felt welcomed with open arms and supported. People would ask me how my first week was going. Eventually, as time passed, people began to ask me how they could support me or if they could help me with something, especially when they saw me struggling to reach the top shelves in the kitchen (I’m four feet and eleven inches tall).</description>

      <guid>/blog/staff-augmentation-vs-project-based-services-for-devops-and-cloud-projects/</guid>
      <description>DevOps tools and practices accelerate software release cycles, but their adoption can be a tricky process. The supply of skilled engineers has not always kept up with demand, there is an overwhelming array of tools to choose from, and the cultural changes required can meet resistance. You might be struggling to find clearly defined blueprints for navigating the DevOps and application platform landscapes, and you may be evaluating staff augmentation or project-based services, which include both consulting and professional services, as ways to accelerate your initiatives.</description>

      <description>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
Arthur C. Clarke
 Most people would consider today’s technology to be magic – so sophisticated it is not apparent to most people how it works, or even that it should even be possible. Cloud computing and related technologies such as Kubernetes (well implemented) or even our own CloudMC and cloud.ca products exhibit magical qualities. Today’s technologists are modern-day witches and wizards, instead of spells, potions, and recipes we have playbooks, git repositories, and CI/CD.</description>

      <description>A CIO decides it’s time for their organization to adopt DevOps. They hire a team of digital unicorns, adopt an array of cutting-edge tools, and are disappointed when they don’t see results. All the ideas, projects, products, and teams being introduced are held back by increasingly outdated cultural norms, processes, infrastructure, and skills. Nothing is aligned with the new operational models and technologies being introduced, and the digital unicorns are locked behind a dam along with their potential.</description>

      <description>DevOps increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity, evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This is accomplished by redesigning processes so development and operations tasks are no longer fully separated by silos.
At CloudOps, we help customers design, build, and operate cloud platforms with DevOps tools and practices. The first phase is always to provide a DevOps Platform and Practices Assessment (DPPA), which provides an objective understanding of the business impact, technical risks, and path to DevOps best practices and cloud native development and delivery.</description>

      <description>AWS came out with its first public cloud offering in 2006, bringing with it extensive debate on the benefits of cloud migration. Claims that migrating to the cloud would cut costs and provide the ability to efficiently respond to demand fluctuations led to many organizations migrating into the cloud, most lifting and shifting their legacy infrastructures into AWS.
AWS has since continued growing its offering and currently boasts the highest market share and richest library of features.</description>

      <description>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. By removing traditional separations between development and operations, it creates dynamic pipelines of continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) that release software in faster cycles and smaller batches. DevOps helps modernize legacy technology systems, allowing organizations to better compete in today’s data-driven software economy.
The adoption of DevOps tools and practices has exploded as a result, and the percentage of IT professionals working in DevOps teams increased from 16% in 2014 to 27% in 2017.</description>

      <description>Containers are built with statelessness as a core principle, but data must still be stored and made accessible to some services. You therefore need a solution that preserves data in the event of container restarts.
Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are the recommended solution to manage stateful applications in Kubernetes. With a PVC, a Pod can request and connect to volumes, which exist independent of the enclosing Pod’s lifecycle.
PVCs offer the advantage of separating Ops from Devs.</description>

      <description>With a couple weeks before KubeCon and an impending presentation, I embarked on a small adventure to try networking together two different Kubernetes clusters with Tungsten Fabric, the goal being to do a live demo at the Tungsten Fabric Developers Summit.
The demo was designed to be a simplified illustration of the broader hybrid/multi-cloud use case of connecting two distinct networks in the context of Kubernetes. This use case is especially interesting in the context of migrating a set of services to Kubernetes, while still maintaining connectivity to other services in the legacy network.</description>

      <description>The use of microservice-based architectures has skyrocketed in the past few years, highlighting their ability to make applications more scalable, portable, and resilient than their monolithic predecessors. But the volatile and ephemeral environments that microservices encourage can make networking inherently problematic.
It can be difficult to establish trust between microservices, slowing down operations. Canary deployments, the idea of rolling out releases to a subset of users or servers, can be complicated.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, CloudOps started working with a large European client who wanted to migrate their workloads into Google Cloud Platform (GCP). They were looking to modernize their application with containers and use the most mature Kubernetes distribution at the time: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). They additionally wanted their application platform to use libraries of automation recipes based on Terraform and Ansible. CloudOps helped them through this migration process, and the architecture was completed in March, 2018.</description>

      <description>DevOps accelerates the delivery of stable, high-quality software from concept to customer by creating dynamic pipelines of continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). A combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools, DevOps can increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. It can modernize operations and legacy technology infrastructures that limit the ability of many companies to compete in today’s data-driven software economy.
Culture is at the heart of digital transformation.</description>

      <description>Containers have changed the way we run applications, providing means to greatly increase their speed, scalability, and efficiency. They are a form of operating system virtualization that is combined with application software packaging to create portable, reusable, and automatable ways of packaging and running applications. Ever since Kubernetes, the container orchestration system, was open sourced in 2015, the landscape of cloud native technologies has exploded alongside wide-ranging commercial adoption.
But container technologies have developed at such a fast pace that their security has often not had time to keep up.</description>

      <description>Software is eating the world and organizations are continuously moving towards software-based solutions to their industry’s problems. They are doing so as part of digital transformations that allow them to deliver stronger financial performances.
Cloud is the enabler of this process as it is breaking down non-digital systems and clearing the way for digitally advanced processes and tools to sustain continuous, as-a-service delivery.
Organizations that improve their ability to deliver software are more able to quickly release features, pivot when needed, comply with regulations, and respond to feedback so as to attract new customers and delight existing ones.</description>

      <guid>/blog/does-the-service-mesh-spell-the-end-for-middleware/</guid>
      <description>Middleware is perhaps fading away in the place of the service mesh as Istio and related technologies continue to garner momentum. They both oversee communication between various applications and services, but can differ substantially in operations as well as paradigms. Prominent in service-oriented architectures, could middleware become irrelevant in today’s container-focused world?
Middleware
Often called “software glue”, middlewarebrings an application and its underlying databases together. It connects a client’s network-generated requests to back-end data, enabling communication by concentrating all messaging in one pipeline.</description>

      <description>Yes, it’s overwhelming.
There is a rising wave of formal compliance efforts today, driven by customer demands, regulatory requirements, and/or the organizations’ desires to demonstrate its internal security controls and practices to external parties. Recent data protection laws have enshrined the individual’s right to privacy and security of their personal data across the globe. As personal information only becomes more valuable, the frequency and severity of security breaches accelerates. Organizations that fail to adequately secure their data face potentially devastating fines and loss of reputation.</description>

Rather than letting feature readiness drive the timing of new releases, Oracle will employ a train release model. New versions will be released every six months – regardless of content. Sun Microsystems, and now Oracle, have traditionally released new versions every two to four years. With this new release train model, the Java platform will upgrade four to six times more often.</description>

Developed in collaboration between Google and IBM, Istio is an open source technology that provides operational control over and behavioural insight into the service mesh of an application as a whole. Sitting above the application layer, service meshes consist of a dedicated network layer abstracted away from microservices themselves. Monitoring the service mesh, Istio enables platform-independent communication between microservices that doesn’t require changes in service code.</description>

      <description>There has been a remarkable increase in serverless computing platforms over the past few years. While few production-ready solutions have been released, the ecosystem has nonetheless matured substantially. You may even have some immediate use cases in your environment or pipeline to consider for a serverless deployment.
Serverless architecture allows web application logic to be processed independently of physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or operating systems. It frees the entity owning the computing system from the obligation to purchase, rent, or obtain servers or virtual machines for the back-end code to run on.</description>

      <description>CloudOps is Betting on 2018! Here’s how.
We continue to race into an ‘everything as a service’ world. The pace is accelerating and the stakes are intensifying. Success in a cloudy world requires software defined operations: end-to-end automation, data collection of all potentially relevant metrics, and smart algorithms that apply predictive analytics (or even machine learning) to ‘big’ data for decision making and hypothesis testing. In 2018, virtuous cycles of lean and agile will operate more closely with computers in the loop leaving humans with the role of steering and supervising like air traffic controllers.</description>

      <description>In the last few years, containerization and microservices-based architecture took the DevOps community by storm. According to 451 Research, container technology such as Docker and Kubernetes will see the fastest growth compared to other cloud-enabling technologies, with an estimated CAGR of 40% through 2020 (see Figure 1). “Two things stand out from our market sizing and research on containers: the breadth and diversity of vendors basing their offerings on containers or integrating and partnering to better support containers in their products and the speed at which the container software and market are maturing based on production, use and revenue growth,” said Greg Zwakman, Vice President, Market and Competitive Intelligence at 451 Research.</description>

      <description>OpenStack has generated phenomenal mindshare among traditional IT vendors, and has succeeded in capturing the attention of enterprise, telecom and software companies alike. As its operational capabilities have matured in the last few releases, use cases are moving beyond dev/test into production. Therefore, choosing the right implementation and support partners in a large and confusing OpenStack ecosystem is on the minds of many end users, especially considering the likely market winners and losers, and resulting consolidation that is likely to happen in the coming years.</description>

      <description>Supplemental Pack for XenServer 6.5 Allows VVOLs-like VDI per LUN Functionality for XenServer and Enables Multi-tenant QoS
Syed Ahmed of CloudOps has completed an open source project to allow XenServer 6.5 to leverage backend SAN snapshots byresignaturing metadata of a copied LUN (Logical Unit Number).
This allows more efficient support of processes that rely on snapshots including backups of XenServer virtual machines by leveraging integrated snapshots on a SAN, in this case SolidFire which is a popular scale-out iSCSI block storage for cloud infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Cloud computing is a revolutionary new model for IT services delivery, allowing on-demand utility consumption that can be fully automated via software. Being able to obtain IT resources like hailing a taxi is an essential characteristic of cloud computing. With such new capabilities, cloud computing enables completely new business models, such as e-commerce flash crowd sales (e.g. Beyond the Rack) and massively parallelized compute work (e.g. modelling drug interactions) while enabling us to improve on old business models, allowing for better, faster and cheaper services.</description>

      <description>About two years ago, I wrote a blog post&amp;nbsp;about my personal experience with the main differences between CloudStack and OpenStack. Since both technologies have evolved, I feel it’s time to take another stab at answering this commonly recurring question : “Should I deploy CloudStack or OpenStack in my organization?”
My first deployments of OpenStack were performed manually and it was really painful. The barrier to entry for deploying such a cloud solution probably discouraged many excellent sysadmins from trying it.</description>

      <description>One of the hardest things I have learned over my career in IT is that no matter how diligently you work to understand and meet business requirements, you almost always end up with too many or too few resources, too early or too late.
While the problem is often due to poor delivery of IT projects and product capabilities, even more frequently it is because either the anticipated business demand isn’t there (and you’re left with greatly under-utilized assets) or, the level of demand is hugely underestimated and the project becomes a victim of its own success.</description>

My goal is to effectively guide clients to get the maximum business value out of cloud infrastructure services. The greatest business value from cloud is the business agility and efficiency it can enable. I have laid out four items I would want to know if I were starting to use cloud.

      <guid>/blog/can-infor-and-netsuite-get-cloud-so-wrong/</guid>
      <description>This article might be a good example of why software as a service (SaaS) should not be called “cloud.” Equating a subscription software delivery model to cloud masks its&amp;nbsp;true value.
http://diginomica.com/2014/11/12/infor-hits-back-criticism-decision-use-aws-cloudsuite/
Let’s start with the old analogy of comparing cloud computing to an electrical utility. NetSuite is adamant that building and maintaining its own power plants is important, when what customers really value is their software.
Also, the author of the article appears to be saying that Infor requires that its clients use Amazon Web Services (AWS).</description>

      <description>Moving to SaaS isn’t easy. But move you must. And if you make the transition, you’ll care about new things:
Different metrics will matter: Moz began by looking at traffic and churn, but today measures the number of net customers added (“net adds”) and the time it takes to pay back the cost of customer acquisition (“customer payback.”) These numbers aren’t closely scrutinized in a licensing model; in SaaS they’re front and center.</description>

      <description>Ultimately, switching from ISV to SaaS means switching from a strict development role to one of development and operations. This isn’t just writing new code, it’s retooling the organization.
Security is no longer about making sure that the codebase is private and virus-free; it’s ensuring that production servers don’t get hacked and that support personnel are briefed against social engineering.
Payment moves from the finance department to become an operational concern involving gateways and automation.</description>

      <description>There are many reasons the future of software is service-based.THE JOURNEY FROM ISV TO ASP TO SAAS…continued!
Economic motivationsOne of the most tempting things about SaaS is that it generates recurring revenues, As long as you deliver a valuable product and avoid customer churn, you build a “war chest” of future revenues that increases the value of the company. You don’t have to re-sell customers every purchase cycle. Clients aren’t depreciating your license over time.</description>

      <description>The fight is over, and Software-As-A-Service won. Software companies that wait too long to move to an on-demand model lose market share, and quickly grow out of touch with their customers.Those are some pretty bold statements…especially if you are an ISV.
THE JOURNEY FROM ISV TO ASP TO SAAS
Since the dawn of computing, there has always been a&amp;nbsp;tension between centralized computing and computing&amp;nbsp;at the edge. Mainframes were centrally managed,&amp;nbsp;but as processing became cheaper, they gave way to&amp;nbsp;minicomputers and servers.</description>

I put together a visualization of the CloudStack API based on the public documentation. &amp;nbsp;This visualization represents the request references from basic entities to other basic entities. &amp;nbsp;The arrow direction is the direction in which the reference is made. So if an API call in the Virtual Machine section references a Network, it would appear as: Virtual Machine-&amp;gt; Network. I am not showing the specific API calls, I am grouping all the API calls for a section together and mapping them to other logical sections.</description>

      <description>It’s been a few years since clouds were new. Today, utility computing is a tool in the IT toolbox, and it consists of both on-premise and on-demand components. We have strong private stacks (Cloud Platform, OpenStack, Eucalyptus, VMWare and others) and a variety of large-scale public providers at both the IaaS (Amazon, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace) and PaaS (Cloud Foundry, Openshift, App Engine, Heroku) level.
Yet there are still plenty of reasons why companies fail to embrace clouds, from governance and compliance concerns to questions around performance and cost.</description>

Certainly, clouds (at least, big public ones like Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Engine) have a lot in common with an electrical utility. They’re elastic, because you can change your demand and pay for what you use.</description>

      <description>In the process of automating CloudStack installation, we’ve been through a challenging part: Creating an Entire Advanced networking Zone from the API. Production and test system that we deploy don’t have building tools such as mavin in order to create zones, pod,networks,… So the usual process is to use the Web UI and follow the “Add Zone” wizard. Well, not anymore!
To create an entire zone using API we are using Ruby with Chip’s cloudstack_ruby_client.</description>

      <description>As a web operations firm in 2005, we were privileged to experience the emergence of cloud computing. At the time, our customers were exclusively e-commerce, SaaS, and advertising-driven publishing businesses. Amazon Web Services (AWS) unlocked what was essentially an unsolved problem — how to right-size your infrastructure to meet the needs of your business — and our AWS solutions provided our customers with just-in-time (JIT) infrastructure.
Most folks outside the industry are unaware that what started as an online bookstore is leading a revolution in computing.</description>

At last count 10M people had bought the game and at least 5 times as many are playing the demo or some mobile version. For the uninitiated, this seems odd. The graphics are awful, and it’s not even a real “game” – in other words, there’s no mission or objective to achieve and “win”.</description>

What is a Web Application Firewall?
By definition, a web application firewall is a device that sits between the client and the web server and analyses layer 7 messages for violations in the defined security policy. In other words, WASFs look at HTTP/HTTPS/SOAP/XML requests and responses and look for potential attacks according to predefined rules on the device or abnormal behavior.</description>

      <description>One of the key principles of Cloud-based development is that everything in that development environment – including the infrastructure — is offered to the user (developer) as a service.
In this new world, you don’t give a development team a server, or a load-balancing device. You give developers access to a storage service and a load-balancing service. Leading cloud providers, public or private, offer a wide array of computing, networking, storage, authentication, database, etc.</description>
